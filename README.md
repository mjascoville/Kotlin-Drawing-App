# Overview

This project was an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge of the Kotlin language. From here, I have a solid base to build on, and I can potentially use this to expand more into mobile app development. 

I wrote a simple drawing application that allows the user to choose between two shapes and two colors. 

The purpose of this software was mainly to familiarize myself with the Kotlin language, but I was also able to work with a graphical interface for the first time; I'd never done anything with windows or drawing before.

Here is a link to a video demo of the project:

# Development Environment

I developed this program using the IntelliJ IDE.

I wrote the program in Kotlin, and I used Swift to handle the graphics and the window display.

# Future Work

Here is a list of things I could add and refine:

- Add a free-draw tool. This would allow the user to draw freehand lines, without conforming them to a specific shape.
- Add a save/load function.
- Create a graphical UI for choosing colors and tools.
